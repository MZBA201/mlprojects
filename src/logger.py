# This brings in Pythonâ€™s built-in logging module
# which lets you log messages (like errors, warnings, or general info)
import logging
# This allows you to interact with the operating system
# for example, to make folders or join file paths.
import os
# This allows you to get the current date and time
# useful for naming log files uniquely.

LOG_FILE = f"{datetime.now().strftime('%m_%d_%Y_%H_%M_%S')}.log"

# Path to the logs folder (just the folder)

# Make sure the logs folder exists

# Final path to the log file inside the logs folder
